# **EcoClean: Waste Classification Using Transfer Learning**

## **Introduction**
This project aims to classify waste products using **transfer learning** to improve waste sorting efficiency and reduce contamination in recyclable materials.

## **Project Overview**
EcoClean currently lacks an efficient and scalable automated waste sorting solution. Manual waste sorting is **labor-intensive** and prone to errors, leading to misclassification and contamination of recyclables. 

To address this, we leverage **machine learning** and **computer vision** to automate waste classification. Our model uses **transfer learning** with a pre-trained **VGG16** architecture to classify waste images accurately.

## **Aim of the Project**
The primary objective is to develop a **high-accuracy waste classification model** that can differentiate between **recyclable** and **organic** waste. By the end of this project, the model will be **trained, fine-tuned, and evaluated**, ready for deployment in real-world waste management applications.

## **Final Output**
- A trained **deep learning model** that classifies waste images into **recyclable** and **organic** categories.
- A well-documented dataset, preprocessing pipeline, and trained model.
- Performance evaluation metrics to assess accuracy and effectiveness.

## **Technologies Used**
- **Python**
- **TensorFlow/Keras**
- **VGG16 Pre-trained Model**
- **OpenCV** (for image preprocessing)
- **NumPy & Pandas** (for data manipulation)

## **Installation & Usage**
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Hatonjan/WasteProductsClassifier.git
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the training script:
   ```bash
   python train_model.py
   ```
4. Test the model:
   ```bash
   python test_model.py
   ```

## **Dataset**
The dataset consists of labeled images of recyclable and organic waste. Ensure you have the correct dataset structure before running the scripts.
